# AyuGram for Android

![AyuGram Logo](.github/AyuGram.png)

## Features

**AyuGram4A** is built on top of exteraGram, which means we have all the features exteraGram has and
some of Telegraher's:

- Built with official keys
- No emulator detection
- Screenshots in secret chats
- Messages history (+ deleted ones)
- No ads
- Probably something else, check commits!

...and **ghost mode**.

Please note that AyuGram does **NOT** include some closed-source exteraGram features.

## Downloads?

## Why there's no `X` feature from Telegraher?

Because I'm too lazy, and some Telegraher's features are useless for the most of people.

## How to contribute

I'd be grateful for any contribution, since I don't really like Java. :)

Work on any feature you want.

## How to build

1. Clone source code using `git clone https://github.com/AyuGram/AyuGram4A.git`
2. Open the project in Android Studio. It should be opened, **not imported**
3. You are ready to compile `AyuGram`

- **AyuGram** can be built with **Android Studio** or from the command line with **Gradle**:

```
./gradlew assembleAfatRelease
```
